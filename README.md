# Arduino-Projects

These are the Arduino projects I made in order to expand my C++ Knowledge as well as my knowledge in using Arduino.

### 01 - Ohm Potentiometer First Test
-> This project prints the string "Hello World!" and the time elapsed in seconds to an LCD screen.<br/>

### 02 - Timed Ohm Potentiometer Value Printer
-> This project prints the time elapsed in seconds to an LCD screen every second.<br/>

### 03 - Ohm Potentiometer Line Drawer
-> This project draws a line in each pixel group of an LCD screen based on the ammount of power 1 Ohm Potentiometer passes.<br/>
-> At 0 power no lines are drawn at 10000 power passed all 16 Lines are drawn.<br/>

### 04 - GF Present
-> This project prints the words "Eu amo-te muito ******* <3 <3 <3" (en: I love you very much ******* <3 <3 <3) to an LCD screen.<br/>
-> This project was built using the same system as 03.<br/>
